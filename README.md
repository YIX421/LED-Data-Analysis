# LED-Data-Analysis
This code will help you get the key figures of merit of LED, including EQE, luminance, current density, and plot all the data into publishable figures. This will help researchers analyze data more efficiently.
A set of raw data (spectra and V-I-L) was uploaded to the files to help you understand how this python code works.
